# Batch Selection System

## Overview
The Batch Selection System (Epic 3, Task 3.4) provides a comprehensive solution for selecting multiple expenses in the expense list for bulk operations. It integrates seamlessly with the existing view toggle and inline actions systems while maintaining high performance standards.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Individual Selection**: Click checkboxes to select specific expenses
- **Master Selection**: Select/deselect all visible expenses with master checkbox
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected rows highlighted with teal background (Financial Confidence palette)
- **Selection Counter**: Real-time display of "X of Y expenses selected"
- **Selection Toolbar**: Fixed bottom toolbar appears when items are selected
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for accessibility

### Selection Modes
1. **Default Mode**: No checkboxes visible, normal expense list behavior
2. **Selection Mode**: Checkboxes visible, row clicks toggle selection

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + A`: Toggle selection mode
- `Ctrl/Cmd + A`: Select all visible expenses (when in selection mode)
- `Escape`: Clear all selections
- `Tab`: Navigate between checkboxes

## Technical Implementation

### Stimulus Controller
The `batch_selection_controller.js` manages all selection state and interactions:

```javascript
// Key responsibilities:
- Maintain selection state (selectedIdsValue array)
- Handle checkbox interactions
- Manage visual feedback
- Coordinate with other controllers
- Dispatch events for bulk operations
```

### View Integration
The system integrates with `expenses/index.html.erb`:
- Checkbox column (hidden by default)
- Master checkbox in table header
- Selection toolbar at bottom of viewport
- Row click handling for easy selection

### CSS Styling
Custom styles in `batch_selection.css`:
- Smooth animations for toolbar appearance
- Indeterminate checkbox state styling
- Selected row highlighting
- Mobile-responsive adjustments

## User Experience

### Selection Flow
1. User clicks "Selección Múltiple" button to enter selection mode
2. Checkboxes appear in first column
3. User selects individual expenses or uses master checkbox
4. Selection counter shows real-time feedback
5. Toolbar appears with bulk action options
6. User can clear selection or proceed with bulk operations

### Visual States
- **Unselected**: Default white background, hover effects active
- **Selected**: Teal-50 background, teal-700 left border
- **Master Checkbox States**:
  - Unchecked: No items selected
  - Checked: All items selected
  - Indeterminate: Partial selection

## Integration Points

### View Toggle Compatibility
- Selection state maintained across view mode changes
- Checkboxes adapt to compact/expanded layouts
- Visual feedback consistent in both modes

### Inline Actions Compatibility
- Checkbox clicks don't trigger inline actions
- Action buttons remain functional in selection mode
- No visual conflicts between systems

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Minimal re-renders
- Event delegation for large lists
- Maintains 5.62ms baseline performance

## Accessibility

### ARIA Attributes
- `aria-selected`: Indicates row selection state
- `aria-label`: Descriptive labels for checkboxes
- `role="status"`: Selection announcements for screen readers

### Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard operability
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Logical tab order
- Screen reader announcements for state changes

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Adaptive Layout
- Checkbox size appropriate for touch targets
- Toolbar adapts to narrow viewports
- Selection counter remains visible
- Bulk actions accessible on mobile

## Testing Coverage

### System Tests (`batch_selection_spec.rb`)
- Selection mode toggle
- Individual and master selection
- Toolbar appearance/disappearance
- Keyboard navigation
- View toggle integration
- Inline actions compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility features

### JavaScript Tests (`batch_selection_controller_spec.js`)
- Controller initialization
- Selection state management
- Event dispatching
- UI updates
- Helper methods

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features (Task 3.5)
- Bulk operations modal integration
- Batch categorization
- Bulk status updates
- Bulk deletion with confirmation
- Export selected expenses

### Potential Improvements
- Persistent selection across pagination
- Selection history/undo
- Smart selection (by date range, category, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts customization

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Selection Mode
The selection mode button can be hidden if bulk operations are not needed:

```erb
<% if feature_enabled?(:bulk_operations) %>
  <!-- Selection mode button -->
<% end %>
```

### Customizing Selection Limits
Maximum selection count can be configured:

```javascript
static values = {
  maxSelection: { type: Number, default: 100 }
}
```

## Performance Metrics

### Baseline Performance
- Selection toggle: < 10ms
- Select all (100 items): < 50ms
- UI update: < 16ms (60fps)
- No degradation to ExpenseFilterService (5.62ms)

### Memory Usage
- Minimal memory footprint
- Efficient selection state storage
- No memory leaks in event handlers

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Security Considerations
- Selection state client-side only
- Server-side validation for bulk operations
- CSRF protection for all actions
- No sensitive data in selection state
