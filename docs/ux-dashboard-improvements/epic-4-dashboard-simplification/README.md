# Epic 4: Dashboard Simplification

## Executive Summary

This epic focuses on drastically simplifying the expense tracker dashboard to reduce cognitive load by 60% and improve user experience through strategic removal of redundant sections, consolidation of related information, and streamlining of the visual hierarchy. Based on UX research findings, the current dashboard suffers from information overload with duplicate sync sections, redundant bank breakdowns, and overly complex metrics that hinder quick decision-making.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Reduce cognitive load by 60% through strategic simplification and consolidation of dashboard elements while maintaining all critical functionality.

### Secondary Objectives
- Improve dashboard load time by 40% through reduced component complexity
- Increase user task completion rate by 50%
- Enhance visual hierarchy for faster information scanning
- Reduce maintenance burden through component consolidation

### Success Metrics
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: 60% decrease measured through user testing (time to find information)
- **Page Load Performance**: < 1.5 seconds initial render time
- **User Satisfaction**: 80% positive feedback on simplified design
- **Task Completion Rate**: 50% improvement in key user flows
- **Code Reduction**: 35% fewer lines of dashboard-related code
- **Component Count**: 40% reduction in unique dashboard components

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **FR-1**: The system SHALL remove all duplicate sync status sections, maintaining only the unified widget
2. **FR-2**: The system SHALL consolidate the top merchants section with recent expenses into a single unified view
3. **FR-3**: The system SHALL simplify metric card statistics to show only essential data points
4. **FR-4**: The system SHALL remove the redundant bank breakdown section
5. **FR-5**: The system SHALL reduce chart complexity while maintaining data clarity
6. **FR-6**: The system SHALL preserve all critical user workflows during simplification
7. **FR-7**: The system SHALL maintain real-time updates for remaining components
8. **FR-8**: The system SHALL ensure mobile responsiveness is improved, not degraded

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR-1**: Dashboard initial render time must be under 1.5 seconds
2. **NFR-2**: All simplified components must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
3. **NFR-3**: The simplified dashboard must support real-time WebSocket updates
4. **NFR-4**: Code coverage must remain above 95% after refactoring
5. **NFR-5**: The dashboard must gracefully handle empty states and loading conditions
6. **NFR-6**: Browser compatibility must include Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC-1: Unified Sync Widget
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the dashboard
When the page loads
Then I should see only ONE sync status widget
And it should combine all sync-related information
And duplicate sync sections should be completely removed
```

#### AC-2: Simplified Metrics
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the metric cards
When I examine each card
Then I should see only primary amount and essential trend
And secondary statistics should be removed or hidden
And visual hierarchy should clearly indicate primary vs secondary metrics
```

#### AC-3: Consolidated Merchants View
```gherkin
Given I am viewing expense information
When I look for merchant data
Then I should see it integrated within the recent expenses section
And there should be no separate "Top Merchants" section
And merchant information should be accessible but not dominant
```

#### AC-4: Removed Bank Breakdown
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the dashboard
When the page loads
Then I should NOT see a separate bank breakdown section
And bank information should only appear within individual expense items
```

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Internal Dependencies**:
  - Completion of Epic 2 (Metric Cards Enhancement) 
  - WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
  - Existing Stimulus controllers for interactive elements
  - Turbo Frame/Stream functionality

- **External Dependencies**:
  - Tailwind CSS framework
  - Chartkick library for simplified charts
  - Browser WebSocket support

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| User confusion from removed features | Medium | High | Gradual rollout with A/B testing and user feedback loops |
| Performance regression | Low | High | Comprehensive performance testing before and after changes |
| Loss of critical information | Medium | High | User research validation before removal decisions |
| Breaking existing workflows | Medium | Medium | Maintain feature flags for rollback capability |
| Mobile experience degradation | Low | Medium | Mobile-first testing approach for all changes |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 (MVP) - Week 1
- Remove duplicate sync sections (Story 1)
- Remove bank breakdown section (Story 4)
- Initial performance optimization

### Phase 2 - Week 2
- Simplify metric cards (Story 2)
- Reduce chart complexity (Story 5)
- Implement loading states

### Phase 3 - Week 3
- Consolidate merchant information (Story 3)
- Clean visual hierarchy (Story 6)
- Polish and final optimization

### Phase 4 - Week 4
- User testing and feedback incorporation
- Performance tuning
- Documentation and deployment

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Changes
- Removal of redundant Stimulus controllers
- Consolidation of Turbo Frames
- Simplified WebSocket subscriptions
- Reduced database queries through better caching

### Performance Targets
- Initial render: < 1.5s
- Time to interactive: < 2s
- Lighthouse score: > 90
- Bundle size reduction: 30%

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all modified controllers
- Integration tests for consolidated workflows
- Performance benchmarks before/after
- A/B testing with feature flags
- User acceptance testing

## Open Questions

1. Should we maintain a "detailed view" option for power users who want to see removed information?
2. How should we handle the transition for existing users accustomed to the current layout?
3. Should removed sections be archived or completely deleted from the codebase?
4. What analytics should we implement to measure the success of simplification?
5. Should we provide a tour or onboarding for the simplified interface?
