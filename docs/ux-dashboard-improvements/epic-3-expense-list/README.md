# Epic 3: Optimized Expense List with Batch Operations

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID:** EXP-EPIC-003  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Epic Owner:** TBD  
**Start Date:** Week 3  
**End Date:** Week 5  

## Epic Description

Transform the expense list to display more information efficiently with compact view, inline actions, batch operations, and smart filtering for improved productivity.

## Business Value

### Immediate Benefits
- **Doubles information density** for better overview
- **Reduces interaction cost by 70%** for common tasks
- **Enables efficient bulk categorization** saving hours weekly
- **Improves pattern recognition** in spending

### Long-term Benefits
- Increased user productivity
- Better expense management
- Reduced time spent on categorization
- Improved data quality through easier corrections

## Current State vs. Future State

### Current State (Problems)
- Only 5 expenses visible without scrolling
- No batch operations available
- Excessive padding reduces information density
- Must navigate away for any edits
- No quick filtering options
- 15+ clicks to categorize 5 expenses

### Future State (Solutions)
- 10+ expenses visible in compact mode
- Checkbox selection for batch operations
- Inline quick actions on hover
- Filter chips for instant filtering
- Bulk categorization in 2 clicks
- 85% reduction in task time

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Query performance < 50ms for 10k records
- Filter application < 100ms
- Batch operations < 2s for 100 items
- Virtual scrolling at 60fps
- Zero N+1 queries

### User Metrics
- 10 expenses visible by default
- Batch operation usage > 30% of users
- Filter interaction rate > 50%
- Task completion time reduced by 70%
- Error rate < 1% for bulk operations

### Business Metrics
- Increased categorization rate by 80%
- Reduced time in app by 40% (efficiency)
- Higher data quality scores
- Decreased support tickets for categorization

## Scope

### In Scope
- Database optimization with indexes
- Compact/standard view toggle
- Inline quick actions (edit, duplicate, delete)
- Batch selection system
- Bulk categorization modal
- Filter chips interface
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Filter state persistence in URL
- Accessibility enhancements

### Out of Scope
- Advanced filtering (complex queries)
- Saved filter sets
- Export beyond CSV
- Custom column configuration
- Expense templates
- Auto-categorization ML

## User Stories

### Story 1: Information Density
**As a** user with many expenses  
**I want to** see more transactions at once  
**So that** I can quickly scan my spending patterns  

### Story 2: Bulk Categorization
**As a** user with uncategorized expenses  
**I want to** categorize multiple items at once  
**So that** I can organize my expenses efficiently  

### Story 3: Quick Edits
**As a** user reviewing expenses  
**I want to** make quick edits without leaving the list  
**So that** I can correct errors immediately  

### Story 4: Smart Filtering
**As a** user analyzing spending  
**I want to** quickly filter by category or bank  
**So that** I can focus on specific expense types  

### Story 5: Keyboard Efficiency
**As a** power user  
**I want to** use keyboard shortcuts  
**So that** I can work faster without using the mouse
