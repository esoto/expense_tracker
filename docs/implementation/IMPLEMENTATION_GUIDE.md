## 🚨 Risk Management

### **Critical Risks (HIGH Priority):**

1. **Data Migration (Ticket 4.1)**

   - **Monitoring**: Real-time validation and error tracking

2. **Tenant Isolation (Ticket 2.1)**
   - **Risk**: Cross-tenant data leakage
   - **Mitigation**: Database triggers, query interceptors, comprehensive testing
   - **Monitoring**: Automated isolation verification

3. **Permission System (Ticket 3.2)**
   - **Risk**: Incorrect access control implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Authorization policies, extensive testing, security review
   - **Monitoring**: Permission audit logging

### **Medium Risks:**
- Performance degradation with tenant scoping
- Complex authentication flow bugs
- UI state management complexity
