# Epic 2: Enhanced Metric Cards with Progressive Disclosure

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID:** EXP-EPIC-002  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** âœ… Complete  
**Actual Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Epic Owner:** Claude Code AI Team  
**Start Date:** Week 6  
**End Date:** Week 8  
**Final Progress:** 100% (6 of 6 tasks completed)  
**Completion Date:** 2025-08-11  

## Epic Description

Transform static metric cards into interactive, contextual displays with visual hierarchy, tooltips showing trends, budget indicators, and clickable navigation to filtered views.

## Business Value

### Immediate Benefits
- **Improves information scent by 60%** through visual hierarchy
- **Reduces time to insight** with contextual information
- **Increases engagement** with financial data through exploration
- **Supports data-driven decisions** with trend visibility

### Long-term Benefits
- Better financial awareness and control
- Increased user satisfaction with dashboard
- Foundation for advanced analytics features
- Improved decision-making with visual trends

## Current State vs. Future State

### Current State (Problems)
- Four uniform metric cards with no hierarchy
- Static display with no interaction capability
- No context about trends or goals
- Unable to explore underlying data
- Confusing color usage (rose for increase regardless of context)

### Future State (Solutions)
- Primary metric 1.5x larger with visual emphasis
- Interactive tooltips showing 7-day trends
- Budget/goal progress indicators
- Click-through to filtered expense views
- Smart color coding based on financial impact

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Tooltip render time < 50ms
- Chart loading time < 100ms
- Click response time < 150ms
- Bundle size increase < 50KB for charts
- Cache hit rate > 80% for metrics

### User Metrics
- Hover interaction rate > 40%
- Click-through rate > 25%
- Time to first interaction < 10 seconds
- Feature discovery rate > 60%

### Business Metrics
- Increased dashboard engagement by 50%
- Better budget adherence (10% improvement)
- Higher user satisfaction scores
- Reduced "blind spending" incidents

## Scope

### In Scope
- Data aggregation service layer
- Visual hierarchy implementation
- Interactive tooltip system
- Sparkline chart integration
- Budget/goal indicators
- Clickable navigation
- Metric calculation background jobs
- Caching strategy

### Out of Scope
- Complex chart types beyond sparklines
- Custom metric creation
- Advanced forecasting
- Multi-currency conversions
- Historical data beyond 30 days

## User Stories

### Story 1: Visual Hierarchy
**As a** user viewing my dashboard  
**I want to** immediately see my total spending  
**So that** I understand my financial position at a glance  

### Story 2: Trend Visibility
**As a** user hovering over metrics  
**I want to** see recent trends  
**So that** I understand if my spending is increasing or decreasing  

### Story 3: Budget Awareness
**As a** user with budget goals  
**I want to** see my progress against limits  
**So that** I can adjust my spending behavior  

### Story 4: Data Exploration
**As a** user clicking on metrics  
**I want to** see the underlying transactions  
**So that** I can understand what drives the numbers  

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Chart.js or similar lightweight library
- Redis for metric caching
- Background jobs for calculations
- Database materialized views

### Frontend
- Stimulus controllers for interactions
- CSS animations for smooth transitions
- Lazy loading for chart library
- Responsive tooltip positioning

### Backend
- MetricsCalculator service
- Efficient aggregation queries
- Caching layer with TTL
- Background job processing

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Charting library selection and integration
- Redis caching infrastructure
- Database indexes for aggregations
- Background job framework

### Team Dependencies
- UX approval for visual hierarchy
- Data analyst for metric definitions
- DevOps for caching setup

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Chart library performance | High | Medium | Evaluate multiple libraries, lazy load |
| Cache invalidation complexity | Medium | High | Clear cache strategy, TTL-based approach |
| Browser compatibility for charts | Medium | Low | Use well-supported library, provide fallback |
| Metric calculation accuracy | High | Low | Extensive testing, data validation |
| Visual clutter from tooltips | Medium | Medium | Careful design, progressive disclosure |
