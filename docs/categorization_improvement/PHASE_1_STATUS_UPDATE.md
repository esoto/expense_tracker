## Next Steps Recommendation

Based on the exceptional performance results of Task 1.7.5, the system is demonstrating production-ready capabilities. The remaining Task 1.7 subtasks can proceed with confidence in the system's performance foundation.

**Recommended Priority Order:**
1. **Task 1.7.2**: Service Integration (focus on orchestration patterns)
2. **Task 1.7.4**: Data Quality (leverage performance tools built)  
3. **Task 1.7.3**: Production Monitoring (build on performance metrics)

The performance validation has exceeded all targets, providing a solid foundation for the remaining production readiness tasks.
