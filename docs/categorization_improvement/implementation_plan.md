## Rollout Strategy

### Gradual Deployment

```ruby
# Week 1-2: Option 1
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors(:quick_intelligence, 10)

# Week 3-5: Option 2
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors(:statistical_learning, 25)

# Week 6-8: Option 3
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors(:hybrid_ai, 10)
# Gradually increase to 100%
```

### A/B Testing

```ruby
class ExpenseCategorizationExperiment
  VARIANTS = {
    control: :old_system,
    option1: :quick_intelligence,
    option2: :statistical_learning,
    option3: :hybrid_ai
  }.freeze
  
  def self.variant_for(user)
    # Consistent assignment based on user ID
    bucket = user.id % 100
    
    case bucket
    when 0..59 then VARIANTS[:control]      # 60%
    when 60..79 then VARIANTS[:option1]     # 20%
    when 80..94 then VARIANTS[:option2]     # 15%
    when 95..99 then VARIANTS[:option3]     # 5%
    end
  end
end
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance degradation | High | Gradual rollout, monitoring, rollback plan |
| Data quality issues | Medium | Validation, cleaning, manual review |
| Model drift | Medium | Continuous monitoring, retraining |
| API cost overrun | Low | Budget limits, caching, alerts |

### Rollback Plan

```ruby
# Quick rollback mechanism

    Flipper.disable(:hybrid_ai)
    Flipper.disable(:statistical_learning)
    Flipper.disable(:quick_intelligence)
    
    # Clear caches
    Rails.cache.clear
    
    # Notify team
    AlertService.notify_emergency("Feature rollback executed")
  end
end
```
