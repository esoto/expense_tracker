### 📋 Usage Instructions

#### Running Different Test Types

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test categories
bundle exec rspec spec/models spec/services           # Unit tests
bundle exec rspec spec/requests spec/channels         # Integration tests
bundle exec rspec spec/system spec/features           # System tests
bundle exec rspec spec/performance --tag performance  # Performance tests

bundle exec parallel_rspec spec/
```

#### Using Test Helpers

```ruby
# In your tests
include_context "with email accounts setup"
include_context "with realistic expense data"
include_context "with mocked IMAP responses"

# Using custom matchers
expect(sync_session).to have_completed_sync
expect(expense).to be_valid_expense
expect(parser_result).to have_parsed_expense_from_email(email_content)

# Using performance helpers
assert_job_performance(ProcessEmailsJob, account.id, session.id, 
                      max_time: 30.seconds, max_memory: 100)
```

#### Page Object Usage

```ruby
# System tests with page objects
dashboard_page = DashboardPage.new
dashboard_page.start_sync_all
expect(dashboard_page).to have_active_sync
dashboard_page.wait_for_sync_completion
```
