# Project Structure Summary

## Organized Folder Structure

The UX Dashboard Improvements project has been reorganized from a single 7000+ line document into a well-structured folder hierarchy for better maintainability and navigation.

## New Structure

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Better Organization
- Each epic is self-contained with its own documentation
- Clear separation between business, technical, and design concerns
- Easier to find specific information

### 2. Improved Collaboration
- Different team members can work on different epics simultaneously
- Designers focus on ui-designs.md files
- Developers reference technical-design.md
- PMs track progress in tasks.md

### 3. Maintainability
- Smaller files are easier to update and review
- Changes to one epic don't affect others
- Version control shows more meaningful diffs

### 4. Navigation
- Clear hierarchy from project → epic → task
- README files provide context at each level
- Cross-references link related documents

## File Size Comparison

### Before (Single File)
- `ux_dashboard_improvements_project.md`: ~7,000 lines

### After (Organized Structure)
- Project Overview: ~300 lines
- UX Investigation: ~400 lines
- Each Epic README: ~200 lines
- Each Tasks file: ~800-1000 lines
- Each Technical Design: ~500-700 lines
- Each UI Designs: ~600-800 lines

## Usage Guide

### For Different Roles

#### Product Managers
1. Start with `/README.md` for project status
2. Review `/project/overview.md` for business context
3. Check each `/epic-*/README.md` for epic status
4. Track tasks in `/epic-*/tasks.md`

#### Developers
1. Review `/project/technical-architecture.md` for patterns
2. Check `/epic-*/technical-design.md` for implementation
3. Reference `/epic-*/tasks.md` for specific tickets
4. Copy code from `/epic-*/ui-designs.md`

#### Designers
1. Review `/project/ux-investigation.md` for context
2. Check `/epic-*/ui-designs.md` for mockups
3. Update designs as needed in HTML/ERB format

#### QA Engineers
1. Review `/epic-*/tasks.md` for acceptance criteria
2. Check `/epic-*/technical-design.md` for test scenarios
3. Reference `/epic-*/ui-designs.md` for expected behavior

## Migration from Original Document

The original comprehensive document (`ux_dashboard_improvements_project.md`) has been split as follows:

1. **Project Level Content** → `/project/` folder
   - Executive summary → `overview.md`
   - Risk register → `overview.md`
   - Timeline → `overview.md`
   - UX findings → `ux-investigation.md`

2. **Epic 1 Content** → `/epic-1-sync-status/` folder
   - Epic description → `README.md`
   - Tasks 1.1-1.4 → `tasks.md`
   - Technical notes → `technical-design.md`
   - HTML/ERB mockups → `ui-designs.md`

3. **Epic 2 Content** → `/epic-2-metric-cards/` folder
   - Epic description → `README.md`
   - Tasks 2.1-2.6 → `tasks.md`
   - Technical notes → `technical-design.md`
   - HTML/ERB mockups → `ui-designs.md`

4. **Epic 3 Content** → `/epic-3-expense-list/` folder
   - Epic description → `README.md`
   - Tasks 3.1-3.9 → `tasks.md`
   - Technical notes → `technical-design.md`
   - HTML/ERB mockups → `ui-designs.md`

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining file creation for all epics
2. Add cross-references between documents
3. Create Notion import templates
4. Set up automated documentation generation
5. Add diagrams and flowcharts where helpful

## Import to Notion

This structure is optimized for Notion import:
- Each folder becomes a Notion page
- Each .md file becomes a sub-page
- Task files can be converted to Notion databases
- Technical designs become wiki pages
- UI designs can include embedded previews

The hierarchical structure matches Notion's page nesting, making it easy to maintain synchronized documentation between Git and Notion.
