## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Dependency Graph
```
3.1 (Database) → 3.2 (Compact View) → 3.3 (Quick Actions)
                        ↓
                 3.4 (Batch Selection) → 3.5 (Bulk Modal)
                        ↓
                 3.6 (Filter Chips) → 3.8 (State Persistence)
                        ↓
                 3.7 (Virtual Scrolling)
                        
3.9 (Accessibility) - Can be done in parallel with any task
```

### Critical Path
1. Start with 3.1 (Database Optimization) - foundation for performance
2. Then 3.2 (Compact View) for immediate density improvement
3. 3.4 (Batch Selection) enables bulk operations
4. 3.3 (Quick Actions) and 3.6 (Filters) can be parallel
5. 3.7 (Virtual Scrolling) only if performance issues
6. 3.9 (Accessibility) should be ongoing throughout

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Filter service logic
- Batch operation transactions
- View mode toggle persistence
- Selection state management

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end batch categorization
- Filter combination scenarios
- Keyboard navigation flow
- State persistence across navigation

### Performance Tests
- Query performance with indexes
- Virtual scrolling with 10k items
- Batch operations on 100+ items
- Filter application speed

### Accessibility Tests
- Keyboard navigation coverage
- Screen reader compatibility
- WCAG compliance audit
- Focus management verification

## Implementation Notes

### Database Considerations
- Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE before and after indexes
- Monitor pg_stat_user_indexes for usage
- Consider partitioning for very large datasets
- Vacuum and analyze after index creation

### Frontend Performance
- Use CSS containment for list items
- Debounce filter changes (300ms)
- Virtualize only when > 100 items
- Lazy load action buttons

### State Management
- Use Stimulus values for UI state
- localStorage for user preferences
- URL params for shareable state
- Redux not needed - keep it simple

### Error Handling
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Clear error messages in Spanish
- Retry logic for network failures
- Graceful degradation for features
