# Complex Testing Scenarios for Deep Dive

This document lists complex testing scenarios that require more detailed investigation and implementation.

## Current Test Coverage Status
- **Before optimization**: 83.65% (926 / 1107 lines)
- **After optimization**: 88.2% (957 / 1085 lines)
- **Coverage improvement**: +4.55%

## Tests Added
1. **EmailAccountsController** - Full controller test suite
2. **EmailAccountsHelper** - Helper method tests
3. **Expense model** - Added tests for `pending?`, `failed?`, and `after_commit` callback
4. **ApiToken model** - Added caching behavior tests

## Complex Scenarios Requiring Deep Dive

### 1. IMAP Connection Service Integration Tests
**Complexity**: High
**Reason**: Requires mocking external IMAP servers and handling various connection scenarios
- Test connection failures and retries
- Test different IMAP server configurations
- Test SSL/TLS certificate validation
- Test timeout scenarios
- Test large email folder handling

### 2. Email Processing Pipeline End-to-End Tests
**Complexity**: High
**Reason**: Involves multiple services working together
- Full flow from email fetch to expense creation
- Handling of malformed emails
- Testing various bank email formats
- Testing duplicate detection across email accounts
- Performance testing with large email volumes

### 3. Background Job Error Handling and Recovery
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Reason**: Requires testing job failures, retries, and recovery mechanisms
- ProcessEmailsJob batch processing failures
- Network interruption recovery
- Partial batch processing scenarios
- Dead letter queue handling
- Job monitoring and alerting

### 4. Dashboard Service Caching Edge Cases
**Complexity**: Medium
**Reason**: Complex caching scenarios with real-time data mixing
- Cache invalidation across multiple operations
- Race conditions in cache updates
- Performance under high concurrent load
- Cache warming strategies
- Partial cache failures

### 5. Multi-Currency Transaction Handling
**Complexity**: Medium
**Reason**: Complex business logic with exchange rates
- Currency detection accuracy
- Exchange rate integration (when implemented)
- Mixed currency reporting
- Currency conversion edge cases

### 6. Email Parser Regular Expression Coverage
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Reason**: Requires extensive test data from real bank emails
- Edge cases in transaction parsing
- Multi-line transaction descriptions
- Special characters and encoding issues
- Different date/time formats
- Amount parsing with various formats

### 7. Security and Authentication Tests
**Complexity**: Medium
**Reason**: Requires testing various attack vectors
- API token rotation scenarios
- Rate limiting implementation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention in email content
- CSRF protection verification

### 8. UX Mockups Controller Tests
**Complexity**: Low
**Reason**: Development-only feature, but should have basic coverage
- Ensure mockups render without errors
- Test layout switching
- Verify development-only access

### 9. System Performance Tests
**Complexity**: High
**Reason**: Requires load testing infrastructure
- Database query performance under load
- Memory usage during large email processing
- API endpoint response times
- Background job throughput
- Cache hit/miss ratios

### 10. Data Migration and Upgrade Tests
**Complexity**: Medium
**Reason**: Requires testing database state transitions
- Schema migration rollback scenarios
- Data integrity during migrations
- Zero-downtime deployment testing
- Backward compatibility testing

## Recommendations for Achieving >95% Coverage

1. **Prioritize Integration Tests**: Focus on testing service interactions
2. **Use VCR or WebMock**: Record real IMAP interactions for reliable tests
3. **Implement Factory Patterns**: Create comprehensive test data factories
4. **Add Performance Benchmarks**: Include performance tests in CI
5. **Create Test Email Corpus**: Build a library of real bank email samples
6. **Implement Mutation Testing**: Use tools like mutant to verify test quality

## Testing Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Test Data Management**
   - Create a test data seeding system
   - Build email template generators
   - Implement data cleanup strategies

2. **CI/CD Enhancements**
   - Add parallel test execution
   - Implement test result caching
   - Add coverage trend tracking
   - Set up performance regression detection

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Create test helpers for common scenarios
   - Add test documentation and examples
   - Implement test generation tools
   - Add visual test coverage reports

## Next Steps

1. Start with IMAP Connection Service tests using VCR
2. Build comprehensive email test corpus
3. Implement performance benchmarking framework
4. Add integration test suite for email processing pipeline
5. Create security-focused test scenarios
