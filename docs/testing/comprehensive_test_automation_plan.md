```ruby
# spec/
├── models/                    # Unit tests for ActiveRecord models
├── services/                  # Service object testing
├── controllers/              # Controller action testing
├── requests/                 # API endpoint testing
├── system/                   # Full-stack browser testing
├── channels/                 # ActionCable channel testing
├── jobs/                     # Background job testing
├── features/                 # Business workflow testing
├── performance/              # Benchmark and load testing
└── support/
    ├── helpers/              # Custom test helpers
    ├── shared_contexts/      # Reusable test contexts
    ├── page_objects/         # Page Object Model classes
    └── factories/            # FactoryBot definitions
```

#### 2. Custom Matchers for Domain Logic

```ruby
# spec/support/matchers/sync_matchers.rb
RSpec::Matchers.define :have_completed_sync do
  match do |sync_session|
    sync_session.completed? && 
    sync_session.processed_emails == sync_session.total_emails
  end
end

RSpec::Matchers.define :broadcast_progress_update do |expected_data|
  supports_block_expectations
  
  match do |block|
    expect { block.call }.to have_broadcasted_to(expected_data[:session])
      .with(hash_including(type: "progress_update"))
  end
end
```

#### 3. Page Object Model for System Tests

```ruby
# spec/support/page_objects/sync_dashboard_page.rb
class SyncDashboardPage
  include Capybara::DSL
  include RSpec::Matchers
  
  def initialize
    visit '/expenses/dashboard'
  end
  
  def start_sync_all
    click_button 'Sincronizar Todos los Correos'
  end
  
  def wait_for_sync_completion
    expect(page).to have_content('Sincronización completada', wait: 30)
  end
  
  def progress_percentage
    find('[data-sync-widget-target="progressPercentage"]').text.to_i
  end
end
```

### Performance Testing Strategy

#### 1. Benchmark Testing

```ruby
# spec/performance/sync_performance_spec.rb
RSpec.describe "Sync Performance", type: :performance do
  it "processes 1000 emails within performance threshold" do
    emails = create_list(:email, 1000)
    
    expect {
      SyncService.new(email_account).process_emails(emails)
    }.to perform_under(30.seconds)
      .and change(Expense, :count).by_at_least(800)
  end
end
```

#### 2. Memory Usage Testing

```ruby
it "maintains reasonable memory usage during large sync" do
  emails = create_list(:email, 5000)
  
  expect {
    SyncService.new(email_account).process_emails(emails)
  }.to perform_allocation(50.megabytes).or_less
end
```

### CI/CD Integration Recommendations

#### 1. GitHub Actions Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          bundler-cache: true
          
      - name: Setup test database
        run: |
          bin/rails db:create
          bin/rails db:schema:load
          
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          bundle exec parallel_rspec spec/
          
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```
