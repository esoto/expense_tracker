# Epic 1: Consolidate and Optimize Sync Status Interface

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID:** EXP-EPIC-001  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** 85% Implemented  
**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Epic Owner:** TBD  
**Start Date:** Week 1  
**End Date:** Week 2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-08  

## Epic Description

Eliminate redundancy in sync status display and improve clarity by consolidating two separate sync sections into a unified, real-time widget with clear action hierarchy and dedicated management page.

## Business Value

### Immediate Benefits
- **Reduces cognitive load by 40%** through elimination of duplicate information
- **Improves sync initiation task completion time** by making primary action obvious
- **Frees dashboard space** for more relevant financial data
- **Provides clear, real-time sync progress visibility** improving user confidence

### Long-term Benefits
- Reduced support tickets related to sync confusion
- Improved user engagement with sync features
- Foundation for advanced sync capabilities
- Better system observability and debugging

## Current State vs. Future State

### Current State (Problems)
- Two separate sync sections displaying redundant information
- No real-time progress updates (users must refresh)
- Unclear hierarchy between sync all vs. individual accounts
- Sync details mixed with dashboard content
- No visibility into sync performance or history

### Future State (Solutions)
- Single, unified sync widget with real-time updates
- Clear primary action (Sync All) with secondary options
- Live progress bar with time estimates
- Dedicated sync management page for details
- Performance monitoring and history tracking

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Real-time update latency < 100ms
- WebSocket connection success rate > 99.5%
- Zero duplicate sync information on dashboard
- ActionCable broadcasting every 100 emails or 5 seconds
- Connection recovery time < 3 seconds

### User Metrics
- 100% of users see real-time progress
- Sync initiation clicks reduced by 60%
- Time to start sync reduced from 3 clicks to 1
- Support tickets for sync issues reduced by 70%

### Business Metrics
- Increased sync frequency by 30%
- Improved data freshness (average age < 24 hours)
- Higher user satisfaction scores (+20 NPS)

## Scope

### In Scope
- ActionCable implementation for real-time updates
- Unified sync widget component
- Sync progress broadcasting infrastructure
- Connection recovery and error handling
- Sync conflict resolution UI
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Background job queue visualization
- Dedicated sync management page

### Out of Scope
- Email provider API modifications
- Sync algorithm improvements
- Multi-account simultaneous sync
- Sync scheduling automation
- Email content parsing enhancements

## User Stories

### Story 1: Real-time Sync Visibility
**As a** user tracking expenses  
**I want to** see real-time progress when syncing emails  
**So that** I know the system is working and how long it will take  

### Story 2: Simple Sync Initiation
**As a** user with multiple email accounts  
**I want to** easily start syncing all accounts with one click  
**So that** I don't have to manage each account individually  

### Story 3: Sync Conflict Resolution
**As a** user with potential duplicate transactions  
**I want to** resolve conflicts during sync  
**So that** my expense data remains accurate  

### Story 4: Sync Performance Monitoring
**As a** power user  
**I want to** see sync performance metrics  
**So that** I can optimize my sync timing  

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- ActionCable WebSocket server configuration
- Redis for pub/sub and progress caching
- Background job processing with Solid Queue
- Database indexes for sync session queries

### Frontend
- Stimulus controller for WebSocket management
- Turbo Streams for UI updates
- Progressive enhancement for non-WebSocket browsers
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### Backend
- SyncProgressUpdater service enhancements
- ActionCable channel implementation
- Sync conflict detection algorithm
- Performance metrics collection

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Redis server for ActionCable
- WebSocket support in user browsers
- Existing SyncSession model
- Current authentication system

### Team Dependencies
- DevOps for Redis configuration
- QA for real-time testing setup
- UX for design review and approval

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| WebSocket connection failures | High | Medium | Implement fallback to polling |
| Redis performance issues | High | Low | Configure connection pooling |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Low | Progressive enhancement |
| Memory leaks in long connections | Medium | Medium | Auto-disconnect after 30 min |
| Scalability concerns | High | Medium | Rate limiting and connection pooling |
