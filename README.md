## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.2+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Node.js 18+ (for asset compilation)
- Redis (for Solid Cache/Queue)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd expense_tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   npm install  # If using npm packages
   ```

3. **Database setup:**
   ```bash
   bin/rails db:setup
   # This creates database, loads schema, and seeds with Costa Rican data
   ```

4. **Configure credentials:**
   ```bash
   bin/rails credentials:edit
   # Add email account settings, API keys, etc.
   ```

5. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   # Runs Rails server, Tailwind watcher, and background jobs
   ```

## Development

### Development Commands

```bash
# Server
bin/rails server                # Start development server
bin/rails console              # Rails console

# Testing
bin/rails test                 # Run test suite (excludes system tests)
bin/rails test:system          # Run system tests
bin/rails test:all             # Run all tests
bundle exec rspec              # Run RSpec tests

# Database
bin/rails db:migrate           # Run migrations
bin/rails db:reset             # Reset database

# Assets
tailwindcss:build             # Build CSS
tailwindcss:watch             # Watch CSS changes

# Code Quality
bundle exec rubocop           # Ruby linting
bundle exec brakeman          # Security analysis
```

### Development Workflow

The project follows a multi-agent development pattern established during Epic 3:

1. **Implementation**: Senior architect implements core functionality
2. **Review**: Tech lead reviews and refines architecture
3. **Testing**: QA strategist ensures comprehensive testing
4. **Integration**: Final validation and performance testing

**Quality Gates:**
- A-grade code quality (90+ scores)
- 100% test coverage expectation
- <50ms database query performance
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Rails Best Practices adherence

### Code Standards

**Service Layer Pattern:**
```ruby
# Extend base services for specialized functionality
class DashboardExpenseFilterService < ExpenseFilterService
  # Add dashboard-specific logic while maintaining compatibility
end
```

**Stimulus Controller Standards:**
- Keyboard navigation support
- Accessibility attributes
- Performance optimization
- Error handling

**Testing Organization:**
```ruby
describe "Feature" do
  context "User Interaction" do
    it "handles primary flow" { }
  end
  
  context "Keyboard Navigation" do
    it "supports accessibility" { }
  end
  
  context "Performance" do
    it "meets requirements" { }
  end
end
```

## Configuration
