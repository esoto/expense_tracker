## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| ActionCable scalability issues | Medium | High | Implement connection pooling, rate limiting, fallback to polling |
| Complex filter combinations causing slow queries | High | Medium | Add database indexes, implement query caching, use materialized views |
| Browser compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Progressive enhancement, feature detection, graceful degradation |
| Data inconsistency during batch operations | Medium | High | Database transactions, audit logging, rollback capability |
| User overwhelm with new features | Medium | Low | Progressive disclosure, onboarding tutorials, feature flags |
| WebSocket connection failures | Medium | Medium | Automatic reconnection, offline mode, status indicators |
| Performance degradation with large datasets | Medium | High | Virtual scrolling, pagination, lazy loading |
| Delayed project timeline | Low | High | Phased rollout, MVP approach, feature flags |
