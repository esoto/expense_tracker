**QA Score Before Fixes**: 72/100  
**Target Score**: 95+/100

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. CRITICAL BUG-001: View Toggle Integration Conflict ✅
**Problem**: Actions were not properly hiding/showing in compact mode. The integration with view_toggle_controller was broken.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `inline_actions_controller.js` to detect compact mode via table class
- Updated `showActions()` method to respect compact mode state
- Added data attribute `data-compact-hidden` for proper state management
- Modified view toggle controller to add `!hidden` class in compact mode
- Actions container now properly tagged with `data-view-toggle-target="expandedColumns"`

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/javascript/controllers/inline_actions_controller.js`
- `/app/javascript/controllers/view_toggle_controller.js`
- `/app/views/expenses/index.html.erb`
- `/app/views/expenses/_expense_row.html.erb`

### 2. CRITICAL BUG-002: Category Dropdown Positioning ✅
**Problem**: Dropdown was clipped by table overflow, z-index conflicts, and mobile positioning was broken.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `positionDropdown()` method for dynamic positioning
- Implemented viewport boundary detection
- Set explicit z-index: 9999 for dropdowns
- Added responsive positioning for mobile devices
- Dropdown now repositions above/left when near viewport edges

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/javascript/controllers/inline_actions_controller.js`
- `/app/views/expenses/_expense_row.html.erb`

### 3. CRITICAL BUG-003: Delete Confirmation Modal ✅
**Problem**: Confirmation dialog was not appearing, delete action proceeded without confirmation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced delete confirmation modal with better visual design
- Added warning icon and clear messaging
- Implemented proper event handling for confirm/cancel
- Added z-index: 9999 to ensure modal visibility
- Improved modal styling with border and shadow

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/views/expenses/_expense_row.html.erb`
- `/app/javascript/controllers/inline_actions_controller.js`
- `/app/controllers/expenses_controller.rb`

### 4. MAJOR MISSING-001: Toast Notifications ✅
**Problem**: No user feedback for successful actions, error states not communicated.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive toast notification system
- Added `toast_container_controller.js` for global toast management
- Enhanced `toast_controller.js` with pause-on-hover functionality
- Implemented toast types: success, error, warning, info
- Added toast container to application layout
- All inline actions now trigger appropriate toast notifications

**New Files Created**:
- `/app/javascript/controllers/toast_container_controller.js`

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/javascript/controllers/toast_controller.js`
- `/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`
- `/app/javascript/controllers/inline_actions_controller.js`

## Additional Improvements
