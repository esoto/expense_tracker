## Implementation Approach

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

**Weeks 1-2 (Epic 1)**:
- Set up development environment with multi-tenant gems
- Create core models and authentication
- Implement invitation system
- Basic UI for account management

**Weeks 3-4 (Epic 2)**:
- Add tenant scoping to all existing models
- Update controllers with tenant context
- Modify services for multi-tenancy
- Ensure background jobs maintain context

**Weeks 5-6 (Epic 3)**:
- Implement expense visibility system
- Build role-based permissions
- Create permission management UI
- Test privacy features thoroughly

**Weeks 7-8 (Epic 4)**:
- Create and test migration scripts
- Polish all UI components
- Complete comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Prepare for production deployment

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Migration (Ticket 4.1)**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing on production copy, rollback plan, DBA involvement

2. **Tenant Isolation (Ticket 2.1)**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, security audit, code review

3. **Authentication Changes (Ticket 1.3)**
   - Mitigation: Gradual rollout, feature flags, session management testing

### General Mitigation Approaches
- Daily standup meetings during implementation
- Code reviews for all PRs
- Continuous integration testing
- Staging environment validation
- Incremental deployment strategy

## Notes for Development Team

1. **Start with Epic 1** - Foundation must be solid before proceeding
2. **Test continuously** - Each ticket should include comprehensive tests
3. **Document as you go** - Update documentation with each feature
4. **Communicate blockers early** - High-risk tickets need extra attention
5. **Consider feature flags** - For gradual rollout of new features
6. **Plan for rollback** - Every change should be reversible
7. **Monitor performance** - Multi-tenancy can impact query performance

## Contact Points

- **Product Owner**: Review and approve UI/UX changes
- **DBA**: Consult for migration strategy and performance
- **Security Team**: Review tenant isolation implementation
- **DevOps**: Coordinate deployment and monitoring

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to adding multi-tenancy to the expense tracker application while maintaining data integrity, security, and performance.
