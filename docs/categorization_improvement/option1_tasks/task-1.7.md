### Task 1.7: Critical Issues Resolution and Production Readiness
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Hours**: 27  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 1.1-1.6  

#### Description
Address critical issues identified in Phase 1 completion review to ensure production readiness before Phase 2. This task resolves test failures, integrates services, implements monitoring, improves data quality, and validates performance.

#### Master Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing tests pass (0 failures)
- [ ] Complete service integration with orchestration
- [ ] Production monitoring and observability
- [ ] Comprehensive seed data (75+ patterns)
- [ ] Performance validation under load
- [ ] Operations documentation complete

- [ ] Performance validated (Task 1.7.5)  
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Cache warming script prepared
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] Alert thresholds set

## Deployment Steps
1. Run database migrations
2. Deploy application code
3. Warm pattern cache
4. Verify health checks
5. Monitor performance metrics
6. Validate categorization accuracy

## Rollback Procedure
1. Revert application code
2. Run rollback migrations if needed
3. Clear pattern cache
4. Validate system health
5. Document rollback reason

## Monitoring
- Dashboard: http://grafana.internal/categorization
- Alerts: #categorization-alerts Slack channel
- Health checks: /health endpoint
- Performance metrics: StatsD/Prometheus
```

### Success Metrics

- **Memory**: Cache usage < 100MB
- **Database**: Query performance < 5ms
- **Accuracy**: >75% categorization accuracy
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime
- **Cache**: >90% hit rate

**Total Estimated Hours**: 27 hours
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for complete implementation
**Quality Target**: 9.2-9.5/10 to match Phase 1 standards
